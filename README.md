My repo for Ludum Dare (and other jams) game sources

## Disclaimer
This is a dump of source code for educational purposes. There won't be any guarantees it will compile, they can use libraries that are not publicly available and in general is most liekly won't work. I won't do any explanations on compilation or how things work, read the code, try to understand.  
Also this is not how I usually write code, this is what happens when I have priority on "it should work" rather than "it should work, but also not be a mess". What do you expect from a game written in 3 days?
