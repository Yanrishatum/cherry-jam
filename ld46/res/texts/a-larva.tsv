1st turn	The morphling is so alien too me I can only vaguely grasp its state and emotions.
1st veggies	A pseudo-fruit. The morphling appears less hungry and more content.
1st meat	A chunk of meat. The morphling appears much less hungry.
1st cloth	Seems like it can use clothes to morph itself further. Fancy.
1st armor	An armor plate is a great morphing material. It brings enhanced protection.
1st toy	The toy just makes it confused at this point. 
1st medicine	Panacea works on morphlings, too! Tough luck figuring out if it was sick though.
1st interact	We both don't get each other yet. But the morphling doesn't seem displeased..?
random interact	What a strange creature...
random interact	So weird...
1st DYING state	Ah. The fear of upcoming death is an emotion universal enough to get through.
1st any other state	What... what does this even mean? 
2nd any other state	Is it trying to communicate?
